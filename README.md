# molweaR
an R package/ Shiny app for MolWear / Lagan &amp; Ehrlich 2021

**Update March 2021:** Thank you for your interest in MolWear for R! We're working to get our android app implemented as a Shiny Web app, that way it can be accessbile on any operating system or device. We hope to have something out in the next few months so stay tuned for updates. In the meantime, check out the original android app **[here](https://github.com/topics/mol-wear)** and be sure to check out the full article in **[AJPA](https://doi.org/10.1002/ajpa.24238)**
